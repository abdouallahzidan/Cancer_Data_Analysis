# Cancer_Data_Analysis
This project predicts the outcome of cancer based on available data.
I chose this project to explore health data and identify how it can benefit people and healthcare corporations in their development. thus help humans.
I depended on Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to predict whether Cancer is malignant or Benign.
